# Text-Similarity-for-Android
1. Demonstration of running text similarity with mainstream accelerators on Android device. 
2. The demo models were uploaded to the drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N7kUqRUI0aE6C2Rb6IcGQzd4D5FRZ-XG?usp=drive_link
3. After downloading, place the model into the assets folder.
4. Remember to decompress the *.so zip file stored in the libs/arm64-v8a folder.
5. The demo models, named 'GTE', were converted from ModelScope and underwent code optimizations to achieve extreme execution speed.
6. Therefore, the inputs & outputs of the demo models are slightly different from the original one.
7. I will make the exported method public later.
8. Twinkle Twinkle Little Star~
